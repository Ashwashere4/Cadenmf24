I am a student attending Rochester Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. All of my coding projects come from me having a "wouldn't it be cool if..." moment. I would like to believe that these projects I do solve real-world problems, but I usually make things simply because I find it cool to do so.
